### Introduction
The tiny parkour dude is fairly impressive. Unfortunately for him though, he's not quite as impressive as he thinks he is. He needs your help. In fact, he's your pet. His entire life is taking place in his terrarium on top of your bedside table.

### Comments
I really wanted to squeeze a Ludum Dare in this weekend, but I ended up doing lots of other stuff instead. In the end, I managed to put in about 8 hours including planning and everything. Taking that into consideration I'm quite happy with the outcome. The level perhaps isn't that fun, and I'd have wanted to at least animate a stick figure, but there was just no time. I also would have loved to design it so that you could see that it's on the bedside table, but with 15 minutes until the deadline, I couldn't think of anything small and made a crane instead, which was pretty much the only design choice that I made.

This was intended to be a jam entry, but then my friend only had time to stay through the beginning of the brainstorming phase, and my girlfriend and her friend who could have drawn some stuff were too busy doing other things, so it ended up being just me making everything.
